# FLoC APIs

> This is a stub

The APIs provided for [FLoC](https://web.dev/articles/floc) are known as the [Privacy Sandbox Proposals](https://web.dev/articles/digging-into-the-privacy-sandbox#proposals). Many of these can be used right now in Chrome with [their Origin Trials](https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/#/trials/active)

> These are likely to only be supported in the Chrome browser, despite nearing standardization
