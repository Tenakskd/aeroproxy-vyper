## What are aero's priorities?

1. Easy to understand and serves the test of time as a great example of how to build a proxy
2. Site support
3. Efficiency
4. Browser support as far back as 15 years
5. Easy to implement / interoperability with other proxies. To the extend of making libraries that other proxies can use. If you see "for proxies" in the heading of the Markdown doc, it can generate a bundle independent of aero.
