# Index - DRAFT 📝

Many of these docs may overlap with aero's dev docs, but the docs in aero's dev docs only/will contain details regarding aero's implemenation and how it relates to the rest of the codebase. These are more general-purpose and intended to be read by other proxy devs rather than for possible aero contributors.

> A lot of the documents that are apart of this proxy guide, such as anything related to sandboxing, are continued in AeroSandbox; however, links to them are in this Index for your convenience.

TODO: List the documents

This guide is explicitly for making your first interception proxy...
TODO: This is a work in progress; don't expect it to be anywhere near complete

## Technology you should know first

- Javascript - Obviously. This should go without saying. I don't recommend using a web proxy as your first project if you don't know Javascript.
- Typescript - optional, but recommended
- A build system such as [Rspack](/Webpack
- [Service Workers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/service-worker-lifecycle#:~:text=Note%3A%20Note%3A%20Regardless%20of%20scope,which%20requests%20it%20can%20intercept.)
