# Documenting your code - DRAFT üìù

## JSDoc

[JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started) allows you to annotate JS files in a human-readable way and, as a result, have them appear in your IDE, or generate them into doc websites. I still recommend TS for type annotations, though.

I recommend adding a header to the top of your files with the description and `@see` block tags that link to the relevant standards and pertinent explainers to what needs to be proxified. I also recommend specifying where your module should be used and how it is built if it is part of a submodule.

## Comment-tagging your inline code

Often, there will come times when you will need to inject a code snippet when rewriting the site content. However, reading the code when wrapped into a template string may be hard because there is no syntax highlighting by default. This is where the plug-ins come in handy!
