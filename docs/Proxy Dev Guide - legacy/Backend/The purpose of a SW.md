# The Purpose of a Service Worker - DRAFT üìù

Service workers do not need to develop a proxy that rewrites on the server. There are many [reasons](../../src/SW-less/README.md) why a service worker might not be a viable use case for you. I developed [SW-less](../../src/SW-less/README.md). Service workers are recommended for proxies because they are performant and prevent the need to hook into browser features that perform network requests, making [request interception](./Request%20Interception.md) easier.
