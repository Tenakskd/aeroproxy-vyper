# Running your SW Proxy in a server-only Mode - DRAFT üìù

You should have abstracted everything in your existing SW handler to the best of your ability. The ideal solution would be to emulate your SW inside the JS runtime of your choice, but we don't live in a perfect world. However, there are projects like [winter.js](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer) and [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) that can help us out here. There are two ways to run CF Workers: [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd) (node.js) and [workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd) (CF's own JS runtime).

## Caveats

### Not all APIs are implemented

Not all APIs are implemented in these solutions.
